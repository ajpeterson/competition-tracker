## Competition Tracker
Shows you the standings of the competitors(teams or individual players) inside the given league and the amount of matches left for the season.

Helps any user of the site to determine:
  * the competitors who are making to the next level and will be participation in the matches left in the season;
  * the competitors who lost their chance to become a champion of the season due to performance;
  * the competitor who became champion for the season once the season is done.
Provides Admin User the interface to assign players to the given leagues and enter the results of the matches (assign wins and loses to the competitors).
