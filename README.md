## Competition Tracker
A two day mock client project employing Agile Development methodologies for the first time. The project was designed to provide insight into working with a real world client and having to alter functionality and design of a web application based on the clients changing demands.

The app features a homepage viewable to anyone and a separate admin dashboard requiring username and password.
  Homepage shows current league standings for competitors(teams or individual players) along with remaining rounds of competition and a count of wins.

  Separate admin dashboard provides Admin User the interface to assign players to leagues and enter the results of the matches (assign wins and loses to the competitors). The Admin can also remove and update players.
